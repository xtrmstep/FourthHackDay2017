# Prediction Validation Sample
Using Boosted Desicion Tree algorithm of Azure Machine Learning studio the Presenter retrieves a sequence of estimated values. After that the estimated sequence is validated against the real one using coeffecient comparison and cross-validdation. The performance of the algorithm is compared with prediction using by-weekly moving average.

# Projects
- presenter - shows ML predictions for several products and validates the estimated values agaiunst real data
- data cleaner - strongly dedictaed for specific case data cleaner.
- samples - projects for testing out some approaches, functions, etc.
